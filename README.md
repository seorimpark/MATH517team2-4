### Setup for Distill
Install it in R via Github using these commands:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/distill")
```
**Do not install it via CRAN, it will not work (package not updated there).** You can try knitting the Rmd template. 
For more information about the package: https://github.com/rstudio/distill

### Main question 
What are the factors favoring a plane crash? What are the similarities between accidents? How to reduce the risks of an aviation disaster for the safety of passengers? 

### Possible subquestions
- Are older planes more likely to crash? (Matias)
- Instruction flights causing severe damages? (Selima)
- Map visualization, states with more accidents? (@Fahim: please let me work on maps :sob:)
- Barplot through time: increase, decrease or constant number of accidents?/Temporal analysis (Zineb)
- Different factors that may cause the accidents (Seorim)
- Severe and minor accidents with PCA (Yiren)

### Variables each person will be working with
| Fahim | Matias | Salima | Seorim | Yiren | Zineb |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - Country<br>- Fu<br>- Localization | - Year of manufacture<br>- ... ? | - Type of operation<br>- Operation phase ? | - Equipment<br>- Manufacturer<br>- Model<br>- Engine type<br>- Engine amount<br>- ... | - Classification<br>- Damage level ? |  - Occurence day<br>- Occurence time |

**Type of occurence** seems worth taking it into account ...
