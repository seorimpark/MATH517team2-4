### Setup for Distill
Install it in R via Github using these commands:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/distill")
```
**Do not install it via CRAN, it will not work (package not updated there).** You can try knitting the Rmd template. 
For more information about the package: https://github.com/rstudio/distill.

### Main question 
What are the factors favoring a plane crash? What are the similarities between accidents? How to reduce the risks of an aviation disaster for the safety of passengers? 


## Report organisation
1- Introduction (Matias - Salima - Fahim)


2- Research questions (Fahim)


3- Approaches (Everyone, bullet points, Zineb will add everything in paragraph)


4- Sources of information / datasets (Seorim) +  EDA (Zineb)
  
5 - Part 1 - Visualisation (Fahim)


6-  Part 2 - Time analysis (Zineb and Matias)

  - Visual and observation (Zineb)
  - Analysis  of Lifespan of Plane(Matias)
7-  Part 3 - Different factors (Selima and Seorim)
  - Occurrence type (Selima)
  - The rest? (Seorim)
  
8- Part 4 - Damage Severity analysis (Yiren)

9- Conclusion (Everyone, bullet points, Fahim)

10- Future improvements (Yiren)



### Possible subquestions
- Are older planes more likely to crash? (Matias)
- Instruction flights causing severe damages? (Selima)
- Map visualization, states with more accidents? (@Fahim: please let me work on maps :sob:)
- Barplot through time: increase, decrease or constant number of accidents?/Temporal analysis (Zineb)
- Different factors that may cause the accidents (Seorim)
- Severe vs minor accidents analysis by PCA, logistic regression (Yiren)

### Variables each person will be working with
| Fahim | Matias | Salima | Seorim | Yiren | Zineb |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - Country<br>- Fu<br>- Localization | - Year of manufacture<br>- ... ? | - Type of operation<br>- Operation phase ? | - Equipment<br>- Manufacturer<br>- Model<br>- Engine type<br>- Engine amount<br>- ... | - Classification<br>- Damage level ? |  - Occurrence day<br>- Occurrence time <br>- Possibly invistigation status, and date of report publish |

**Type of occurrence** seems worth taking it into account ...
